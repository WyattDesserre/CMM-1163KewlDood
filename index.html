                        Wyatt Desserre is a first-year student in the Multimedia Production Program at Lethbridge
                        College with a particular focus on video and image editing. In his spare time, he enjoys playing
                        video games and editing images into comedic amalgamations. Both interests led to his interest in
                        the design and production of said forms of media, as his skill in the editing software Pixlr
                        garnered the attention of his educators, who advised him to pursue this odd skill in the
                        workforce and in his education. In his high school career, he received the Honors with
                        Distinction title on multiple occasions, as well as Honor roll even more times, along with
                        receiving the ‘Most Improved Graduating Student’ at Coalhurst High School. Wyatt has a lot of
                        volunteer experience, from assisting in the operation of a Garage and Bake Sale, raising $400
                        for the Jack Ady Cancer Center, to working at the Pure Casino to raise funds for his local high
                        school. Wyatt also has assisted his teacher in maintaining the trees at Coalhurst High School,
                        from removing harmful objects to watering each tree manually, he applies himself to his maximum
                        to complete anything he puts his mind to with excellence and efficiency. And even with all this
                        said, he still values humor to an incredible degree, never letting it get in the way of his
                        work, but there is no situation Wyatt can't make a joke out of, and he brings a nice light to
                        any situation with his humor. Like, just look at that dumbass in the photo right there!</p>
                    <break></break>
                    <p>Wyatt grew up primarily in Coalhurst, Alberta, though for a short period of his life he lived in
                        Elkford, British Columbia, though that time he was too young to fully remember. Born in 2005 and
                        living in a small town for as long as he can remember, he has grown a strong attachment to the
                        town, growing his aspirations and values. Thankful for those who helped him grow to be better,
                        he pushes himself to make those people who had faith in him proud.
